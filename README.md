# Flashcard-App-Android

<<<<<<< HEAD
This Android application is part of my Flashcard-App series. Students can access flashcard decks made by teachers and stored in Google Spreadsheets. Teachers get a unique code for each deck of cards they register on the teacher web interface (Flashcard-App-TeacherUI), and students can access those flashcards upon successfully entering that code. Whenever a student starts or stops studying, a REST request is made to the back-end server, which records that student action.
=======
The difference between this branch and the master is that there is no plan to further develop school-specific flashcard capability.
